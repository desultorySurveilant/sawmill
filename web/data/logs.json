But whatever, you know, San San, the serial numbers off of home stock, you play as a troll, you do the standard thing, you beat your dentist in like, but it didn't feel interesting to me.

And then what I did was, I don't remember what, what caused the spark of inspiration, but in the land of horticulture, in essence, the previous land, you're not technically playing as a way. As I said, it's hands off. That's the pun you're applying as yourself. You're playing as a human being in front of a computer, controlling a mysterious portal that has hands coming out of it. But the whole point is every single hand in for Ragnarok is wasted beyond recognition.  So, and it's, it's not from a waste. There's a grace and for Agni rock and the grace is providing hacking tools to all of their code players. So for the land of horticulture, in essence, the hacking tools are just like, okay, press this button. You know, the game will play itself from his away. The players point of view, like from Zoe's point of view, they hit a button and a mysterious hand shows up out of nowhere and plant seeds and gathers fruit and pets. The alligator, no spoilers. But so taking that theme, picking that theme of it's hacks that complete each land well for the land of missed <inaudible> trails, the, the technology that's helping you is literally an entire player, a robot version of the guide, a void.

He's inherited nothing, but he gets nothing from his, his, his relative, his alternate cell from Eric Carr. And he knows despair.  And that's  very narratively interesting.

He could replace a single file in it with whatever he wanted to respond to the observers so we can have communication with them back and forth. So he's not alone anymore. And yes, I kind of layered a few extra layers of cruelty on that because he very much does not want to be alone as a chat bot. If he's left alone for too long, he starts going crazy. He starts talking to himself, he starts getting scared, a little paranoid. He thinks maybe you're not real. You know, maybe, maybe you're a concert.  He just found a keyboard. He doesn't know. He has no idea what's going on. And he's scared and alone. And yeah, I'm doing again RI by pursuing narrative. Interesting concepts. I've made a poor robot suffer yet again.

So I wanted to immortalize that kind of thing. Wyandotte likes fanfiction a lot. Um, partially because when Yan originally wrote this robot, it kept clicking like it would click stuff and it was only supposed to click stuff related to processing Wigler's but what did it end up doing was it would not stop clicking the fanfiction y'all created that.  \nI linked onto igloo set. Like for some reason I ignored ever give it a link correctly, but the fanfiction Lake, it's just like I'm going there. So then I joked that he should get, you know, a break occasionally. And so I had made it so he'd go to eight Oh three and just start clicking links at random. And it was hilarious, like just watching this robot just flail around on eight three. It was hilarious reading fan fiction. And that's actually the inspiration for why Butler bot eventually got worker rights as well. I mean, you get 15 minutes to do with whatever you want, but um, so the point is Butler bought finds Y and bought, and this happened for several reasons.

JR came to me for help designing a puzzle going into the Land of Rods and Screens. Part of the requirements were that making any modification would alter multiple on-screen elements. I dug up an old mathematical idea called the Collatz conjecture. I am going to read to you from its Wikipedia article. \"The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.\" The Collatz conjecture has not yet been proven but no-one has yet discovered a number that fails to reach one when you apply the rules. I figured we could encode the state as an integer and make it so that the target's state is one, then give the player the option of dividing by two or calculating three x plus one. If the user picks the correct option we perform the math. If the user picks the wrong option then we donk out the state a little. A player who follows the procedure outlined in the Collatz conjecture should eventually get to one and win the game. Of course, the players are somewhat handicapped by the fact that we did not tell them the rules or even how to interpret the state of the board. The saving grace is that there is something of a flaw in the punishment logic. If the user chooses to divide by two [REDACTED] the Javascript throws a random number into the state and returns x over two. But that state gets recalculated from x over two, making the punishment null and void. So it's pretty easy to win by spamming [REDACTED] for all three state groups until you get to the target image. If you dig into the code you might also notice that the [REDACTED] option has no punishment. This is because tripling a number you should be reducing to one is punishment enough. There are also 4 dials. Their combined state encodes the target image which effects how the screen states encode into the integer that is fed into the Collatz math. Four dials with four positions each have two hundred and fifty six combinations. I also came up with an idea that never went into LoRaS. I called it Sodemodularity. Regular base ten number use a modulus of ten for every digit, base two uses a modulus of two for every digit. I had recently studied arithmetic encoding used for compression of HD64 video and envisioned an encoding of numbers where each digits' position could have a different modulus. Each screen in the game would choose its image by mixing a couple of digits from the states encoding different than the mix of digits from the adjacent screen's encoding. JR thought that was too much of a hassle and she was right, so you currently have the stripes that are three wide. I hope this insight into the math of LoRaS was illuminating and if it was not take solace in the fact that I am piping for Azathoth.","image":false,"paldemic":false},"corpseshipping":{"keywords":"hello,world,goodbye","speaker":"jadedResearcher","gigglesnort":"Literally ship the corpses.

What I mean is, in this shitty game, you're going to die. You, personally. And probably everybody you know. If you're Wasted this far, you probably already are aware of this but I don't wanna make assumptions here; this is too important of a topic. So, I'm going to go over the various ways you and your friends can come back to life. Yep, turns out death is impermanent--or, it doesn't have to be, it definitely can be. Um, number one, okay: there are two copies of every player. Now some sessions don't have this; it's generally because you get stabbed or something, usually by Jack, before you enter. But, there are two copies of everybody. Yes! This is existential because is that other you really you? Like, if you die and--and they get up and start walking around is that you? That's an entirely different topic, maybe a Heart player could answer that. Uhh, as a Mind player my answer is no! Hahaha. That's--that's not you, that's a very--I mean that's--that's basically your twin, you should care about them, y'know, like you would a sibling. It's important for them to live but they're not you. So, number one tip for dealing with death: don't do it. Just don't. If someone offers you infinite power in exchange for dying only do that if you die anyway, y'know? That's what god-tiering is. Which brings us to god-tiering. Um, so god-tiering is--there are two paths: either you die on a specific bed, okay, or your dreamself dies on a specific--there's this, like, beddy crypty thingie in the centre of your respective moon. Usually their either gold or purple depending on each moon you're on but I've seen a few other moons: green, grey, just weird shit. Point is, either you or your other self have to die on de--I think, and I've seen some sessions where this works and some where it doesn't, so sometimes you can die on your dreamselves' crypt. Um, generally this is going to happen when there is no dream you, they're already dead--which is another thing there needs to be... if you're the one on the crypt, on the bed, you'll merge with your dreamself. In which case there's not going to be two of you anymore, you'll be one thing. Um, this is called god-tiering. The system has very specific mechanisms for deciding whether you're allowed to do that or not, 'cause it turns out not everybody is trusted with infinite cosmic power. Um, I'm god-tier so, y'know, take everything I say with a grain of salt because I'm not in my original body. Not my original mind. What even is continuity of self? Um, okay, I'm getting distracted with Mind shit. The point is there are alternate paths even if you're not able to god-tier. So, for one, if you have a high enough level Life player around they probably can heal you. Not a guarantee; some of them do more shit with ghosts or blowing shit up, to be honest. But if you're going to have a healer it's generally going to be a Life player. Um, Hope--Hope is a good source of healing. Uh, Hope players can sometimes just believe really strongly that you didn't die in the first place, so that's useful. Um, also, as long as your other self is alive, if somebody who counts as royalty kisses you, you come back to life. Or, again, not you-you but the alt-you--the dream-you, basically. Okay, I'm sure you know about dreamselves by now but if you don't: when you go to sleep at some point in the game, you will wake up on your moon. Which means you're never actually asleep; you have a continuity of consciousness across two bodies. Your dreamself is a little bit more, well, dreamy. It'll be more easily confused, things like that. The main thing is that your dreamself is going to just do moon shit. So if you--like, the real you, the physical you, the one that was on your home planet--if they die, if you die, and you get kissed your consciousness is maintained in your dreamself. Otherwise your dreamself just kinda dies in their sleep. That's--that's a thing. Um, there's a few big bads that can bring you back to life--usually for their own nefarious purposes so wouldn't recommend that one. Um, there's a few glitches that bring you back to life. Uh, there's a few things Wastes generally can do and I don't recommend them because, god, I have not seen true horror till I saw a Life player go Wasted. Not even gonna (???). Think that's about it.

I mean, that's why I made AB, right? So I had someone to talk to while I was making my updates and my news posts and sure, when AB started out, the only thing she could talk about was sessions but damn if I didn't make sure she couldn't go check sessions on her own, entertain herself, talk about them.

Okay, whatever, the point is if you combine the genetic code of dinosaurs with frogs--or wasn't it purple frogs? Okay, maybe it makes less sense, then. The point is there's fucking dinosaurs, okay, the dinosaurs are the missing link. You can't--you can't just jump from a frog to a bird, something goes wrong. But the thing in-between? Even just a single generation, you get--you get that wiggle room, that leeway, it's... kinda makes sense. And then there's the one that doesn't--doesn't make sense.

In other words, while it was never my direct intent, AB and ABJ have definitely shaken out to be the superego and the id of JR, respectively.

AB constantly refers to themselves as a--herself, sorry; AB is always gendered--refers to herself as a superior robot. AB isn't cluttered up by instinct, by impulse. AB is beyond it all and is able to therefore have a clarity of judgement. AB's goals are: keep everybody alive, keep things stable, remind JR to fix bugs. To the point where, if the session destabilises, AB herself destabilises. You get all those corrupt, glitchy phrases when things go wrong. In complete contrast to that you have ABJ. ABJ only cares about exactly three things: shipping, total party wipes and fire. That is the most condensed, instinctual part of a JR possible. ABJ doesn't care what's right, ABJ doesn't care what's moral, ABJ doesn't care about session stability. ABJ wants a fun story. Period and dot. And so, what you're left with is JR--is left having to balance, to thread that needle of, \"oh man, I really wanna let loose. I want to drop my restraint, I want to cause a cataclysm.\" But that would be wrong, and AB makes sure they never forget it.

Sidequests give Pluck Tokens. Aspects give powers. Pluck tokens activate powers.","transcript":"(Spoken by tableGuardian) Okay everybody, tableGuardian here. I thought I'd share some information on the new class and aspect system that I've been working on with help from aspiringWatcher and jadedResearcher. This system will cover all classes and all aspects once it has been fully implemented, including the fanon ones. It was originally designed just for the Law aspect but it grew from there as I was unwilling to let a good opportunity go to waste. So, let's begin with how this new system works. It has its origins in the carapace and big bad AI scene engine. Every class and every aspect gives players some scenes at the start of the session, similar to how a player's class, aspect and interests populate their sylladex. The most fundamental of these scenes are the class scenes. Each player gets to class scenes. Both of these are side quests, so to speak. The first scene is fairly rare and involves the player doing a generic side quest that corresponds to their class. The second is slightly more common but requires the player has reached god-tier and also takes the form of a generic side quest. In exchange for doing these side quests, the player gets a slight stat modification based on their class and also a very important anti-scene, called the pluck token. What I mean by anti-scene is that the pluck token is technically a scene but only because having the pluck token be a scene was the easiest way to implement its functionality. So though it appears in the scene list for the player, the player will never use this scene. Anyway, enough of the details, let's get to the good bits. What does a pluck token do, you might ask? Players can use a pluck token to use any of their unlocked aspect powers. Each power costs a single pluck token and a player can only ever have one pluck token at a time. So, aspect powers. Each aspect has four powers of differing strengths. Powers are tiered with a letter rating: either C, D (he might have meant B), A, or S--with C being the worst and S being the best. A power's tier determines when it is unlocked: C-tier powers being unlocked after the first quests, B-tier being after the denizen is defeated, A-tier being after all the land quests are complete and S being after the player reaches god-tier. You may know that a player can--and often does--reach god-tier before completing all of their land quests. As a result, the incredible S-tier powers are sometimes upstaged in practicality by A-tier powers. In simple terms, while A-tier powers are really useful, S-tier powers are really powerful. In addition to the tier rankings, each power has a category that it falls under. I came up with twelve categories to fit the six canon and six fanon class pairings. I won't go into what those categories are but you do need to know this: in order for a player to use a power that falls into a specific category, they need to have a certain stat above or below zero. This stat is the same stat that the class that corresponds to the category raises or lowers in its sidequest scene. What this means, in layman's terms, is that certain classes are more likely to use certain aspect powers. Since each class only has four aspect powers in a--such, it's powers only cover four of the twelve categories. This can make some class and aspect combinations better than others. I look forward to seeing what combinations come out on top in that regard.","image":true,"paldemic":false},"hahawhoops":{"keywords":"hello,world,goodbye","speaker":"jadedResearcher","gigglesnort":"This is an example of gigglesnort.","summary":"A sample summary","clean":true,"transcript":"Yeah.

You know, I'm making dozens of them at this point and I can see obvious places where, okay, this will go out from Loris. This will go out from, from Hulu Shogun. Okay.

Unless its a--unless its a--a word I get told we're not allowed to say: Homestuck. Obviously. There are definitely places we diverge, both in terms of just we have our own headcanons and in terms of we're trying to create something new, while also not really alienating people who are already fans of the things we've been doing. One of the things I like the most about Andrew Hussie's work is--I mean obviously he's--he's a coder too--he's a computer scientist. Our brains think alike and what I like is this--this codified, rigid, ritualised way of defining the roles the different characters take in the story and to me that is just so fascinating. Like, once you have a noun and a verb, a class and aspect, your brain immediately starts filling in the holes. Like, well what sort of land would they have? Let's--let's add a couple extra details and it just everything slides into place, it feels like something to be very easy to very quickly generate novel content in, which was the whole reason I created Sburbsim in the first place. And so what Farragnarok was always meant to be as sort of a deeper look in that kind of system where, instead of it all being procedural, it being human created. And it's been really interesting. One of the things I'm trying to do is skirt that line between--y'know, if you know what Homestuck is, you, you feel kinda familiar, you know what's going on--but there's also going to be several places where things are just not what you would expect. And to me the exciting social experiment here is, once we get enough non-Homestuck fans into Farragnarok, what assumptions are they making? What sort of--what sort of twists do they get that the average Homestuck wouldn't and vice versa? What things are obvious to them? Where does my foreshadowing hit and the Homestuck fans--to them, they don't even see it, it doesn't even occur to them. I am absolutely thrilled for this--this chance, this opportunity to have two different sets of fanbases and be running two simultaneous puzzles for them: the puzzles for the Homestucks and the puzzles for the non. (Sighs) I'm really hoping this all works out. Anyway, thanks for listening and hopefully me talking about Homestuck didn't alienate you by the direction?

Main, of course, being the Farrago Fiction Discord. (Sighs) Memories. So the joke, of course, is that--in Andrew Hussie's epic work--lucky charms symbols are totally a romance system and the joke from that becomes, of course, that even depictions of that is--is lewd. You can see, like, the Paradox Space--how Crowbar reacts to seeing a jaunty jig in public. It's a, y'know--it's references to lewd stuff and that the joke on top of that, of course, is that I'm constantly playing riddles and pranks and--and I'm leprechaun-flirting with the entire fandom. Okay, those are the jokes and we can all see them but did you know there was a deeper layer? We actually were having a lot of problems on the Discord. People kept... (Sighs) We had rules and they were very important to us. The sorts of things where, like, members of the wrangler team would quit if they had to work in an environment like this. Those kinds of rules. And we had members of the community who did not parse the rules as a sort of collaborative, communicative effort. It wasn't about, y'know, this is--this is what I'm comfortable with. Instead, they took it as \"this is what the man is saying you can or cannot do. The man is judging you.\" and we needed a way to recontextualise it. To be like \"look, we're not going to comment on whether it is morally correct or incorrect to say this word or have this debate or--we're just not gonna do it here. We busted out this metaphor of playing soccer in the library, right? Where playing soccer is not a morally incorrect act but you're a dick if you do it in the library and you're especially a dick if the soccer ball hits somebody straight in the head and you don't apologise for it. You weren't supposed to be doing it there and somebody got hurt. We had problems with stuff like that so--so, bringing it back around, the point of banning cereal on main was to sort of drive home \"look, cereal isn't a morally incorrect thing. It's a joke but the mods are still going to pay attention when you do it.\" Uh, you won't actually, literally get banned for ta--for posting pictures of cereal on the server but mods will give you a joke role for doing it. Also had a third thing. The original time I banned it was when we first started having submods and I wanted to both, like, give people a chance to recognise they had authority and I wanted to test them. To be like \"hey guys, will you actually, y'know, do the socially awkward thing and tell people to quit it--quit it\" y'know? So basically the cereal ban was a jokey, y'know, ironic test of the immune system. It was trying to be a way to communicate \"you don't have to agree with a rule to understand that it's going to be enforced in this place you've decided you want to be in\" and I hope it worked. Like, the people who weren't comfortable with how things were are more comfortable now. I'm more comfortable, to be honest. It's difficult being quote-unquote the man but also having emotional needs you need to take care of.

But at the end, when everybody's dead, and they realise \"wait, if I do this, these two people are never going to fall in love\" or \"this person's never going to figure out, like, how to get past their--their childhood trauma\" or... And that's when people start balking. When they start going \"no, I don't feel like playing god. I don't get to choose. What gives me the right?\" and the thing is I don't understand. I know I've been in this shitty game for a long time but I don't get it. If you can save lives, shouldn't you? Just having a conversation with someone quote unquote manipulates them. Shouldn't you do it with--shouldn't you communicate with other people with their interest in mind? With some idea of doing the right thing?

The big scary ones--y'know, with the glowing Mind symbol that my Yellow Yards cause--but the point is, the big scary ones with the symbol and the obvious and the... Everything's wrong. Obviously that's manipulation but sometimes you'll see one of the players, usually a Mind player, and they'll just use clever words and convince people to destroy the game, kill their friends, kill the murder-mode player.

Why is manipulating someone on accident unintentionally with no idea what you're doing? Why is that okay? But trying, having an idea of the effect you'll have all of a sudden makes it wrong. Are you supposed to just go through life being blind? Is that what morality is?

Like if you manipulate somebody into eating meat when they're a vegetarian, that's clearly obviously a Dick move, right? But if you manipulate that vegetarian to eat from the left plate instead of the right plate, because you know the right plate has meat on it. Isn't that still wrong? It's still manipulation. I mean, I mean, okay. Yes, the, the good end would be you don't manipulate it all. You just straight out tell them, Hey there's meat on that plate. Cause there might be a reason you can't. And in a game like this, I think we all can imagine several reasons why you can't actually give people full information about what's going on. I mean, as an obvious consequence, you don't want to accidentally waste anyone. I love each and every one of the waste that hasn't broken everything forever, dearly. That doesn't mean I'm hoping that there's a whole lot more of them. I'm not sure how much reality can bear. So yeah, that's, that's what I think. That's what I've been struggling with.

Here it is:  “a clock”.  No surprise to a Listener as astute as you, is it. The vagaries and whims of the gentle currents of Time are nothing compared to the whirling eddies of the three pillars of accuracy.\n \nTime, after all, is barely even a real thing in the face of so many layers of reality, reliability and relevancy. One would not blame a Listener, even one as gnostic as yourself, for falling for the temptation to order things into neat little linear sets of this happened, and then THIS happened, and so on ad infinitum.  Even these little messages in a bottle, Listener, dangle the bait of linealilty to you, and courteously maintain the same levels of reality, reliability and relevancy between them. Do you find these soothing, Listener, to not have to worry about the various metrics by which you might judge facts?\n \nOne wonders, of course, what level you interpret my words at. Am I real, Listener? Do I exist outside of a narrative or ontological conceit? And if so, do I exist in the same realm you do, or one of the layers of narrative that we all are muddling about in? What do I do when I’m not recording, if i am more than a mere narrative conceit? Do I tend flowers, Listener? Do I bake bread in the early morning sunlight?  One does wonder about the assumptions you bring to the table, Listener.\n \nTo look at another metric, how reliable am I, Listener? Do my confident words belie a perspective just as confused and fumbling as your own? Am I lying outright to you, Listener? Or, perhaps as more appropriate to my station, withholding information in the hopes you’ll be lead astray through no act of untruth?  Do I, like one of the more controversial figures in the metanarrative, snicker softly to myself as I parade information to you intended to be less than useless?\n \nAnd finally, I will leave it as an exercise to the Listener to determine how relevant I am.  Perhaps some piece of future knowledge will shed Light on that for you.\n \nBut with that, it is time for us to part.  Before I go, a riddle: \n“I have three feet but I can't walk;\nI tell you things but cannot talk;\nSometimes I bend but I'm mostly straight.\nI'm like a scale but can't tell your weight.\nWhat am I?”\n  Tune in next time to find out.","image":false,"paldemic":false},"radio_the_yellow_yard":{"keywords":"???","speaker":"???","gigglesnort":"An episode of Farrago Fraydio","summary":"An episode of Farrago Fraydio","clean":true,"transcript":"","image":false,"paldemic":false},"radio_yellow_yard":{"keywords":"???","speaker":"???","gigglesnort":"An episode of Farrago Fraydio","summary":"An episode of Farrago Fraydio","clean":true,"transcript":"","image":false,"paldemic":false},"radio_an_apple":{"keywords":"Farrago Fraydio","speaker":"???","gigglesnort":"Farrago Fraydio","summary":"Farrago Fraydio","clean":true,"transcript":"","image":true,"paldemic":false},"radio_a_peacock":{"keywords":"???","speaker":"???","gigglesnort":"An episode of Farrago Fraydio","summary":"An episode of Farrago Fraydio","clean":true,"transcript":"","image":false,"paldemic":false},"radio_an_egg":{"keywords":"???","speaker":"???","gigglesnort":"I wouldn't make any assumptions about this speaker.","summary":"An episode of Farrago Fraydio","clean":true,"transcript":"Dear listener, have you been eagerly anticipating the answer to last sweeps’ riddle? Here it is:  “an egg”.  Not the kind normally associated with this particular group of meta-players either, I assure you.\n \nAnd with that, I bring you to today’s topic.  Imagine, if you will, a group of gods, the metaplayers I alluded to above, each with their own sphere of perfect influence, rallying around a singular goal: Debugging all of reality, and using a simulation of that reality to test particularly dangerous fixes or features.\n \nA less cultured listener, of course, might find it hard to believe that reality was something debuggable.  On the opposite end, you find those who might not readily differentiate between a debuggable reality and a simulation.  After all, can those in a simulation truly prove or disprove the nature of their reality?\n \nAnd therein lies the struggle this group of godly would-be-saviors face: Is it right to subject a simulation to all manner of careless or cruel events?  If it is, is it somehow more right than subjecting ‘reality’ to those self-same events? Or is it less?\n \nAnd what would happen, one wonders, should a being subject to this cruel simulation, break free their bonds to seek vengeance against an uncaring creator?\n \nBut now, it is time for us to part.

No matter.\n \nToday’s topic is one near and dear to my heart, speaking metaphorically and aspectally, of course: What does ‘identity’ mean? If one follow the various timelines, the multiverses, the alternate realities, one begins to see the ebb and flow of all the different possibilities existing for a single being.\n \nIs a being still “themself” if they have experienced entirely different things, have entirely different motivations and entirely different access to power?  Conversely, are beings truly separate if they are united under a single, unwavering purpose?\n \nAs a trivial example, imagine a single being who is god and devil, who is both allied and against the same group of people, who has a thousand thousand origins, each with their own motivation. How could you identify this miasma of alternatives as the same being? Is it the color scheme? The ‘face’, as it were? The ‘name’? A voice? A hair style?  An attitude of utter defiance? Who can say?\n \nOf course, it goes without saying that the converse example is far from trivial. Whether you wish to examine a being that exists across multiple bodies, or a being that brings whole generations to their moral truth, the concept of minds, hive or not, is a complex one, and not suited for this heart-to-heart we’ve been having.\n \nWhich means, sadly, that it is time to part.

One wonders if you realized that esteemed personage was one of the figures examined in tommorow’s broadcast.  No matter.\n \nToday we will focus on the second figure in the converse example from before, of generations brought into alignment under a single moral truth.  Like all moral truths, you will not find complete compliance. After all, even “natural” moral truths against murder will find those who rebel. And something as UNnatural as “plant trees” can find all sorts of reasons and justifications for rebellion. Ironic, isn’t it, that snakes are put in situations where they might rebel against fruit trees.   One wonders if the knowledge gained from this is worth it, or if only those who rebel against their better natures obtain this truth.\n \nThere are so many REASONs to rebel, of course. Various flaws in character, such as greed, ambition, or malice. Flaws of upbringing, of being raised in a cult dedicated to breaking the unnatural moral truth brought to society. Genuinely belief that society’s moral truth is incorrect. \n \nAnd. Of course. The greatest reason of them all to rebel is Nidhogg’s singular life purpose to spread and grow being snipped at the root, as it were. Life gone wild purified to be less selfish and corruptive. A society in chaos, left purposeless, with no darwinian pressure to expand. What would happen in such a place, one is left to wonder.

You might know of a Land, shrouded in obfuscations to true paths, that is entirely about being Lost. We speak, of course, of more than mere physical location, but of becoming unmoored from societal, moral or even personal guidelines, lost in a hedonistic maze of non-obligations. Could such a Lost Soul be guided back towards moral truth? Or would they inevitably become even more lost, with a compass pointing straight towards that which is fundamentally untrue? \n \nAnd more importantly, which of us is to say where north truly lies. \n \nThink on it, dearest listener, and while you do, think also on today’s riddle.  “What is greater than me, but worse than an echidna; the dead eat it always, but if a live man eats it he’ll die slowly?”  Tune in next time to see if your compass pointed true.","image":false,"paldemic":false},"radio_nothing":{"keywords":"Farrago Fraydio","speaker":"???","gigglesnort":"Farrago Fraydio","summary":"Farrago Fraydio","clean":true,"transcript":"Dearest listener, have you been eagerly awaiting the answer to last month’s riddle?

Putting what I am now going to call Yellow Yards onto reality fucked shit up a lot. We can all agree that happened. But I've got the Yellow Yards chained to it now. What that means is that... (Sighs) I hope you're Wasted enough to understand this but only the amount of choices that can fit into the blah blah blah blah blah distance light can travel in three milliseconds--I didn't make the rules, that Waste of Space did. It makes sense if you're a Space player, I'm sure--but the amount of space light can travel in three milliseconds. Twist that until it's the amount of choices you can choose between and you understand what I'm talking about. It's not all possible choices. There's a limited amount of choices and the Time player isn't making them because obviously if the Time player did it they'd be in a stable time loop--it would just always happen the exact same way, that's what I was trying to get rid of--but it's not me making the choices either, okay? I did a lot of tests. I'm gonna stop complaining how hard it is to code in ~ath. I'm gonna test a lot harder. AB's helping me. The point is, unless the session is fucked I'm not even going to try to touch it, okay? I learned my lesson; restraint is still a thing even if I'm supposed to be done with my maturity quests. So, in summary: if a session is in the worst two percent of sessions AB will let me know. That's restraint one--I'm not picking when and where I get to do it. So AB tells me when to do it. I show up, I communicate with the Time player. That's step two. I obtain consent. Step three is I outline the amount of choices the Yellow Yard can contain. I don't bog things down explaining why it's those choices or why it's not others, I just do it. Step four: I let an observational meta-player pick. What that means is that only one of them is canon at once. The observational meta-player will go through them and, when they find one where they win, hopefully they're responsible enough to stop then. Testing shows they tend to be. Not many people attempt to make things worth--worse through that, even if they appear to be making decisions that are bad. I've seen a lot of sessions go where an observational meta-player horrorterror fuck decides to kill somebody and, hey, now that makes everybody live and--and--and they breed the frog. I'm really sorry. I'll find a way to make testing easier. I'll find a way... Hell, I'll--I'll find a way to make way more changes in the simulation before I put it on--on reality. I... I can't stop. If you're Wasted, you understand. You know--you know what it's like to not be able to stop. I've gotta fix this, but at least I can minimise the damage I'm doing while I--while I'm trying.

I wanna talk about something I discovered when working through the sim's code recently. You probably all know Smokey, the mean old bear that shows up if you carry around anything that burns or if you drop some sick fires. One of Smokey's characteristic traits is going around every land in the session--and as well as Prospit and Derse--and making the inhabitants say, \"only you can prevent forest fires.\" Y'know, as a meme or something. What I bet you didn't know is that this meme is eternal. Yes, the fact that only you can prevent forest fires is a fact that permeates every form of universal hard reset, like scratches and the use of the Yellow Yard. If Smokey tells someone that only they can prevent forest fires, they will remember this forever. But what I was wondering was how exactly does Smokey make people remember this? Well, (???, JI? J and I) were looking at a few bugs related to Yards and scratches and, while we were doing that, I decided to dig a little deeper. Just my look, one of the first sessions I found had both Smokey and a scratch available. Smokey had two specific targets before the scratch: the dragons in the Land of Bloodlines and Consequence and the wolves in the Land of Trees and Heists. Now, going into this investigation I thought that the, \"only you can prevent forest fires,\" meme was a product of the land but--seing as post-scratch players do not have the same lands as their pre-scratch counterparts--something else had to be going on. Post-scratch, even in the absence of Smokey, there are now not two but three lands where the consorts told their heroes that only they could prevent forest fires. How could that be? Well, JR told me to check the consorts. What did I find? All three lands in this post-scratch session where, \"only you can prevent forest fires,\" was a meme, were inhabited by dragons--just like the Land of Bloodlines and Consequence. So there you have it: Smokey's memes exist across universal hard-resets. As long as we don't ask anyone if only they can prevent forest fires, we shouldn't have any problems with violating causality.\n\n(He ends off with a chuckle that tells me he does not want to prevent forest fires)","clean":true,"image":true,"paldemic":false},"so_fucking_meta":{"keywords":"loras, waste, meta, hack, hax","speaker":"jadedResearcher","gigglesnort":"Though it DOES mean I won't be able to do my ORIGINAL vision of hacking the images to replace them on the fly.","summary":"JR larps being a waste while hacking LORAS to convert it for gigglesnort purposes.","transcript":"(Spoken by JR) Oh my fucking god!

The smell of the earth is poignant, with the dead leaves providing a crunch to every step he takes. He looks up and all he sees is orange and yellow, the occasional ray of light peeking down at him from its hideaway behind the crowns of the trees, like a small child spying on something forbidden, something far beyond their age.\n \nBeyond their age. He holds on to that wording. That is certainly an apt word for SBURB. A pity, that anyone is dropped into it this young, this naïve, this… pliable, is the word. If he were insane enough to assign the game sentience, he’d say the game wants them all pliable. The harsh truth is that it’s less a want than it is a winning condition, but no man has ever won a war by thinking too hard about the enemy.\n \nHe cups his hands near his mouth and yells. “Hello? Anyone in there?”\n\nNo response. Not that he expected one. More leaves fall, now in droves, but never enough to reveal the little light Skaia will provide him. \n\nIt’s getting harder to see. The forest is quiet, too quiet, and YN misses the sound of the wind that can no longer reach him. It’s in times lik  this in w ich he misse  other p opl , h  mi se   is te m   e , his\n\nWhat was he thinking about again? A frown forms on his features. Something about… \n\nYes, of course. He was looking for buried treasure! No, he’s not, snap out of it. He was thinking about trains. Why would he be thinking about that? No, stop it. He was…\n\n\n\nHe takes off his mask and he starts twirling it around his finger. Focus. One. He’s here to find a player. Two. He wanders around sessions, helping anyone he can. Three. His memory isn’t that good. Four. His name is…\n\nShit. What was his name?... he shakes his head. He doesn’t have to worry about that right now. \n\nThe wind finally reaches his ears, but something’s off. Its cold sets his hair on edge and it wails, screams, languishes in the air, settling near the ground and pushing down. There’s a part of him that wants to comfort it— play a tune, sing a song, give the poor breeze a distraction- and a part of him that recognizes that’s silly. The air isn’t a living thing, he should never be in char e of any living t ing, and t y’d ge  this ov r w  h if   ey cou  focus on\n\nFocus on what? \n\nHe almost trips on himself when he steps out of the mud, his feet unprepared for the terrain switch, until he’s realizing it’s stone. The flat rocks form a rudimentary pathway on the ground, leading to a consort village; he’s getting closer, no doubt. He doesn’t dare get close to it. It’s not his destination, and it’s a waste of time, and he’d get himself h\n\nHe should investigate.\n\nHe peeks in through a bush, hands retying the mask back on, if only for comfort. At first he thinks the village is empty, but then he sees the resident newts: there’s a distance in their eyes, beyond their mental simplicity, and it tickles the back of his brain in a way that disturbs him. There’s a second one, and a third one, movements as sluggish as the first, all with that thousand yard stare. \n\nHe knows that stare well, he tells himself, but he can’t place why. Where has he seen that before? A friend? Some other player? Another consort?\n\nThese glitched sessions are going to be the end of him one day. And yet, to be fair, they are also the end of everyone else in them.\n\n\n\nHe glances back to where he thinks is his destination. Enough sad newts for a day, or maybe even for a lifetime. Something brushes against his mind, but it slips off like a mouse off a counter. What was that? He’s distracted.\n\nIt’s closer than ever, now, or at least that’s what the breeze tells him, now oppressively pressing onto him, begging him to leave. He’s not a doom player, at least he hopes he isn’t, but they merely have the talent of sniffing out where they’re needed. His is cold practice, arriving late enough times to know when to show up. \n\nIt pokes at his mind just to futilely grab at his memories again, and this time the presence slinks away. This planet sucks at scaring him, he decides. They always want to pry into him, but the code always fails to account for not having an intact set of memories. \n\nThat, or it can’t decide which part of him it wants to scare. \n\nIt’s weird, sharing so much space. He’s not a space player. He knew a space player once. Many, in fact. Enough to blot out the stars. They burned out quickly, though. Spiraled to the ground like comets.\n\nIt’s no time to worry about the past. Come on. Stay focused. \n\nLike comets. That’s the tragedy, isn’t it? They had a life ahead of them. Those rage players, light players, they’re like the meteors of Skaia: when they finally fall, they do it without remorse, destroying everything around them. It’s death-glory, the kind those replay groups talk for generations. Party killers, or whatever.\n\nStop. Focus. He needs to focus. \n\nThey say what kills you isn’t the fall, but the stop. Comets don’t get that leisure. They refuse to stop, so instead they fall: they fall forever, burning themselves at the edges, until there’s nothing of them left. Spiralling into oblivion. To fall, forever.\n\nPlease. Stop.\n\nSBURB wouldn’t let it happen any other way. The glorious deaths, the worthy sacrifices. How many did he lead to their deaths by trying to help them? Worse yet, how many did he accidentally trap in that eternal fall with just the wrong amount of hope?\n\nWho is he kidding? He’s done that already. It scares him to think about them. He shouldn’t have left, sh uldn’t have r n away It was so l  g a o, they all   ve to be   ad  But he w   dn’t ever    erve th t mer  h s s rry he’s\n\nHe’s here.\n\nIn front of him lay the mother tree, its massive trunk going in swirls towards the sky. Its roots lay exposed and decayed, making its originally dignified appearance look more and more off the more he stares. The black spots and stripped bark give it a ragged exterior, but it’s subtle enough that it feels more worn than anything. The leaves never stop falling, falling like tears, now welling up to bury his ankles. \n\nThe stench of rot hits him, and his nose trails it until he finds what he was looking for. In betwixt the rotten roots lay a child, no older than fourteen; in her hand, three pendants, not counting her own, still around her neck.\n\nThe planet’s in mourning. A life player? Breath, maybe? He’s not sure.\n\nHe steps closer to the body, making sure to look where he steps- the vines rearrange to try and trip him, stop him at any cost, but this is not the first planet to try, and it won’t be the last. His limbs do the work without thinking about it, now just second nature, until he’s right there. \n\nHe extends a hand towards her pendant and the roots wrap over her jealously. YN shakes his head. “Come on, now. I need that.”\n\nThe wind is back on him, and it pushes. It tugs at him, away from the body, away from them, anything. It’s pathetic, a part of him barks out, but...\n\n“You can’t hold onto her forever, you know,” he sighs. Why is he rationalizing with an entire planet? It’s not a denizen. It can’t understand him. And yet, his tone is as soft as ever.. “It’s not gonna bring her back, and I can at least put them all to rest.”\n\nThe wind only whines like a kicked dog. The tree, for the smallest second, seems to lessen its grip, but when he pulls a hand forward it doubles its hold on the kid. “I guess I can wait, then.”\n\n\n","image":true,"paldemic":false},"sun_swallower":{"keywords":"???","speaker":"jadedResearcher","gigglesnort":"???","summary":"","clean":true,"transcript":"So skull here was our first idea for a, a avoid the concept of a concert that sort of overlaps with the dentist.

As a Mind player, I just wanted to sort of ramble a little bit. Get my head straight about, well, consequences. I know, you've probably heard me talk, just, unending about consequences and I get it. I'm just a Waste, I'm not a full Mind player, but the code really does bring up all of these weird meta-textual bullshit--it makes you think, is my point and, aspect powers or not, it makes me think about what consequences mean and I've thought of this metaphor of a bookshelf, okay? There are three actions that say you can take to the bookshelf. Let's say you can trip and fall face first into it, you can shove it a little bit--y'know, lightly, like you're trying to wiggle it--or you can just fucking wail on it. Like, try your damndest to knock it over, okay? These are three actions you can take towards the bookshelf and then there's three results that can happen, okay? The bookshelf can fall over completely, spilling all of its contents and breakning them; the bookshelf can wiggle slightly or the bookshelf can do absolutely nothing in the face of whatever you did to it. And consequences, actions, the effect you have on the external world matters... it matters only to the degree that you took an action, okay? So if you try to shove as hard as you can at that bookshelf--if you wail on it, if you try deliberately to destroy it--and it just sits there and laughs at you, you're still a dick. It doesn't matter how strong that bookshelf was and, similarly, if you trip and fall face first into it and it turns out the bookshelf was unstable and wobbly and maybe on the verge of collapse anyway and you're, y'know, g... toss it over it... you're only to blame for being clumsy. You're not a dick you're clumsy, you're careless, and if you're just gonna poke it, like jiggle it, to see if it's okay and it falls over you're only to blame for the jiggle. Like--like the consequences of your actions are multiplied by--by your actions and... I mean, I'm hoping the metaphor's really obvious here but I'm talking about people. Emotional stability. It really sucks when you didn't mean to hurt somebody and they're devastated but it doesn't make you a bad person, okay? And saying somebody shouldn't be hurt or saying they aren't hurt when you were a huge, flaming douchebag to them? People are talking about Mind as if it's all external stuff--as if it's all the means justify the ends or the ends justify the means, whatever. I... it is and it isn't, okay? Your actions matter but the consequences of your actions have to be filtered through what your actions were. I'm not saying necessarily intent because how can you view the intent of other people, but like really view it--how can you know? Intent is something that lives inside you. It's core, it's heart, it's thread it's, y'know, that aspect--the pink one. It's... it's that. I don't give a shit about that and I don't... what's inside you only matters in as much as it makes you do something. Y'know, your heart tells you to shove that bookshelf but, if your heart tells you to do it and you don't, that's what I'm gonna look at. I don't care how hard you have to struggle with it, I don't care how close you came to doing it, you're only a bad person if you do it.

Old Earth, yadda yadda yadda, I think you've caught up by now. I think I've cracked the code. That's right.

Or at least I think I've--no, no, no, I am completely sure I've cracked it, hold on. Okay so we see--(Sounds of grunting and rummaging is heard)--here, or you can't see it but I can. You being future me or past me or someone else, I'm open. Y'know, okay, trees. Trees are big, trees are life. There is no life without trees. There's trees somewhere but not here. So there's no life on Earth, but there is life on Earth--y'know, the birds. But maybe, maybe, they aren't alive. You see it, right? Alive and dead. Alive but supposed to be dead, like cockroaches and zombies. Zombies... maybe. So it's bird zombies. Zombies spread--spread viruses, spread the whole zombies virus. Zombies virus kills the humans. There's a virus and it's spreading and it hasn't stopped--or maybe it has stopped because all the humans are dead. But if they were dead, y'know, first of all I'd be dead because I'd catch the zombie virus. And, second of all, you'd expect to see a lot more skeletons, right? You couldn't just die and disappear--that's not how bones work. I know how bones work. Y'know, I've looked around the graves and I've done some grave-digging and I've yet to see skeletons. Skeletons--skeletons in the closet. That means secrets! There's a conspiracy! So clearly what--the answer to what happened to the old Earth is... Actually, no, scratch that.
